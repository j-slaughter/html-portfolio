<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Jennifer Slaughter. I am a web developer. I am still in the learning phase of my journey,
  but in the short time since I have started, I have grown a lot. I discovered my passion for coding during
  the COVID-19 pandemic. Everyone was re-thinking what they really wanted to do with their lives and I was as well.
  I was working as a veterinary technician, and even though I enjoyed what I did, I was burning out pretty quickly.
  I knew that being a vet tech was not my lifelong career purpose, but I did not know what else I would enjoy doing. 
  So I took a online test and it stated that my interests aligned with software developement.
</p>

<p>At first, I dismissed the idea. To me, a software developer was that character in the movies that was a super genius hacker. 
  I thought, "No way can I do that!". But I continued to research it because I was intrigued. According to this 
  online test, software developers were both analytical and creative, something I thought described me well. I eventually
  stumbled upon Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course online. It changed my life.
  I was not only understanding the concepts presented, but it was so much fun. I found myself coding every single day. 
  I decided two weeks in that I was going to become a software developer.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, unlike many others, I had to continue to work through the pandemic in-person. Veterinary professionals 
  were deemed "essential workers", and so my job at an emergency hospital did not change during the pandemic, it just became
   even more overwhelming. My coding education took a backseat as I became more and more fatigued. Now, two years later, I am 
   working at a different job as a vet tech and have re-ignited my software developer journey. My goal is to have a full-time 
   position as a software developer by 2024!
